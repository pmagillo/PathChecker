The executable of the demo (file pathchecker.jar) has been compiled with javac version 10.0.1, 
so it needs to have java version 10.0.1 or superior installed, in order to be executed.

It is still possible to download the sources and recompile with another version. 

See the README to find instructions for running the demo, and to recompile it.
